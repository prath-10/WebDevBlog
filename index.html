            <h2>Template Website</h2>   <br>
            <p>The most ordinary method to start a website would be to set up a Wix/WordPress/ Squarespace site and apply a template. It just may be the easiest and most flexible blogging and website content management system (CMS) for beginners. These websites provide a broad range of different types of website templates available for purchase or free depending the theme. These can help you get a website up pretty fast and easily. </p>

            <h2>Custom Web Design </h2>     <br>
            <p>A custom-built website is generated from scratch. It is coded according to whatever your need or your business requirements. Custom built websites involve a individual/team behind your business. It starts with a creative process to understand who is your target audience, who do you want to reach, how you want/need the website to function and how do you want to look on the internet.</p>

       <h3>
         Pros of a template website
       </h3> <br>
       <p>
         • If your budget is tight, then this might the option you should be going with as it save's you some money. <br>
         • Save a lot of time as the templates are pre-built to meet certain common functionality requirements.<br>
         • Easy to make your own as no coding is required.<br>
         • SEO optimisation.<br>

       </p> <br> <br>
       <h3>
         Cons of a template website
       </h3> <br>
       <p>
         • The additional support you get with a template theme is generally very slow. It can take weeks to find solutions.<br>
         • There can be restrictions and plugin conflicts if you want to customize the theme.<br>
         • Potential design compromises<br>
         • The build is often bloated with extra code and so it runs slower than a custom theme.<br>
       </p> <br> <br>

       <h3>Pros of a custom website</h3>
       <p> <br>
         • Fewer limitations, as when you’re investing in a new website for your business, the last thing you want to do is compromise. <br>
         • You will get all necessary features. <br>
         • Very customisable. <br>
         • Custom functionality. <br>

       </p> <br> <br>
       <h3>
          Cons of a custom website
       </h3> <br>
       <p>
         • Custom design and development is a major time investment. <br>
         • More expensive. <br>
         • Any changes to the site may take time. <br>
         • You will have to rely on your developers time and availability. <br>

       <h2>What to Choose?</h2>
       <p>
         Both a template and a custom-made solution can properly handle business challenges. <br>
         The presence of an expensive exclusive design is not a guarantee that users will immediately love it. <br>
         But an exclusive project allows you to improve user experience through a unique design and a high level of usability. This option is better suited for those who know their target audience well and want to create a website for it.
